# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
This project was created using machine learning to predict the survivals in the titanic sinking tragedy.
Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning is a tool that uses data to guess if passengers survived the Titanic sinking.
It looks at factors like age, gender, and ticket class to make its guesses. 
The goal is to understand what influenced survival rates on the ship.
The competition is simple: Use the Titanic passenger data (name, age, price of ticket, etc.) to try to predict who will survive and who will die.
This is a binary classification. Binary classification is the task of classifying the elements of a set into two groups on the basis of a classification rule.
Finally,completed this project giving perfect Accuracy with Logistic Regression.
